%% Rebar does not detect that it needs to rebuild escripts, so we need to tell
%% it to do so via artifacts declarations. Paths are relative to where you're
%% building though, and the build directory of an escript is always relative to
%% the top level directory. This means that we need to override the path to
%% something relative to us...
