%% 1. Permission is defined as a pair {object, operation}
%% 2. Objects are organized in the tree structure with common root []
%% 3. One vertex of this tree can be parametrized: {bucket, bucket_name},
%%    wildcard all can be used in place of bucket_name
%% 4. Permission pattern is a pair {Object pattern, Allowed operations}
%% 5. Allowed operations can be list of operations, all or none
%% 6. Object pattern is a list of vertices that define a certain subtree of the
%%    objects tree
%% 7. Object pattern vertex {bucket, bucket_name} always matches object vertex
%%    {bucket, any}, object pattern vertex {bucket, any} matches
%%    {bucket, bucket_name} with any bucket_name
%%    otherwise vertices match if they are equal
%% 8. Object matches the object pattern if all the vertices of object pattern
%%    match corresponding vertices of the object.
%% 9. Each role is defined as a list of permission patterns.
%% 10.To find which operations are allowed for certain object in certain role
%%    we look for the first permission pattern with matching object pattern in
%%    the permission pattern list of the role.
%% 11.The permission is allowed by the role if its operation is among the
%%    allowed operations for its object.
%% 12.Each user can have multiple roles assigned
%% 13.Certain permission is allowed to the user if it is allowed at least by
%%    one of the roles assigned to user.
