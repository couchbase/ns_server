-module(ns_online_config_upgrader).

%% This module implements the online upgrade of a cluster.  "Online" here
%% means "when the cluster comes online"; in other words, when it is
%% formed.  This happens after the individual nodes have gone through the
%% node upgrade process.
%%
%% The online upgrade upgrades the configuration starting with the lowest
%% possible cluster version, regardless of a node's version.  This is done
%% both when we are upgrading a node running down-rev software and when we
%% are forming a cluster composed of nodes running up-rev code.
%%
%% If we are forming a cluster containing one or mode nodes running up-rev
%% code, a node's configuration may contain entries which are up-rev
%% relative to the cluster version being upgraded.  Consequently, the
%% functions used to perform the online upgrade must ensure that they are
%% not adding configuration information which is already present in the
%% node's configuration.  If this is not done, we can end up with duplicate
%% information in the configuration.
