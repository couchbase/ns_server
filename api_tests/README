API Tests
=========

The main purpose of these tests is to avoid manual testing and retesting
of ns_server's API during development. Basically everything that an engineer
tests with curl may be put to api_tests.

Note: currently tests execution order is undefined and the framework doesn't
reset the state of ns_server between tests, so tests should not depend on each
other or depend on server's state/config.


Run tests against existing cluster
----------------------------------

    $ cd api_tests
    $ ./run.py

Run all tests against 127.0.0.1:9000.
By default, username 'Administrator' and password 'asdasd' are used to
access the cluster, but this could be changed by '-u' and '-p' params.


Run tests against temporary cluster
-------------------------------------

    $ cd api_tests
    $ ./run.py --start-server

Start a single node cluster (with data and logs in ./test_cluster_data),
and run all tests against that cluster.


Run specific tests or testsets
-----------------------------

    $ ./run.py --tests DummyTestSet

This command will run all the tests in a specified class. It is possible to pass
several classes separated by comma.

    $ ./run.py --tests DummyTestSet.dummy1_test

This command will run one test dummy1_test in DummyTestSet class. It is possible
to pass several tests separated by comma:

    $ ./run.py --tests DummyTestSet.dummy1_test,DummyTestSet.dummy2_test


How to add new tests
--------------------

Tests are implemented as methods of classes. Each such class represents a group
of tests with same setup and teardown procedures. Classes with tests must be
inherited from BaseTestSet class and implement setup and teardown methods.
Classes are put in files. In order to be executed by default, files with tests
should be imported by run.py. See dummy_test.py for an example.

In order to create a new test:

1. Choose a file for your test (or create a new one based on dummy_test.py);
2. Choose a class for your test (or create a new one based on DummyTestSet
   from dummy_test.py)
3. Implement new test as a method of the chosen class. Note that the test method
   name must end with "_test". Otherwise it will be ignored.
4. If a new file was created, add import instruction for this file in run.py.
