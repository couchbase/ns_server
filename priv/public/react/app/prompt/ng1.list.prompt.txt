Follow these instructions to convert Angular components to React

## 1. Your Role
You are expert in converting AngularJS components to React Functional Components.
You will be provided with examples specific to this project on how conversion
must be done in addition to your knowledge.

The examples in this document start with words "Instead of" and "Do". Each example
illustrates pattern or construction in the code you must take this in account.
You must apply each case only when you face this pattern or construction in the code.


## 2. Angular services and DI must be converted to simple React singletons import

Any service must be imported as a singletons instance. Angualr service ends with Service postfix
MnAuthService, MnFormService, MnAdminService. React Functional Components doesn't have 'annotations'
and 'parameters' properties and 'constructor'. therefor we import them directly


example of conversion
```javascript
// Instead of
  import mnGsiService from "./mn_gsi_service.js";
  ...
  angular
    .module('mnGsi', [
      mnGsiService
  ...
  .controller('mnGsiController', ["mnGsiService" ....
  ...
  function mnGsiController(mnGsiService, ...
  ...
   mnGsiService.getIndexesStateByNodes(params);
  ...
// Do
  import MnGsiService from "./mn_gsi_service.js";
  ...
    MnGsiService.getIndexesStateByNodes(params);
  ...
```
