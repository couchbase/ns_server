# README

There are three kinds of prompts in this directory:

- `.prompt.md` - add them to the Composer, provide the file context, and let the AI do the rest,
- `.prompt-recipe.md` - fill out the values in the recipe to suit your context, and then paste the filled out recipe into the Composer,
- `.prompt-example.md` - a fully filled out prompt, feel free to edit it's values directly, and use in Composer. I might modify it to be more customizable later, but it's just experimental now.
