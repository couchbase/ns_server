#### Expected

The idea was to have the AI do more **granular tasks, step-by-step**, so that it takes smaller steps and so is more accurate.

#### Actual

The AI **lost the big picture rules of `ng2.component.prompt.md`** and required a lot of manual cleanup, leading me to revert and try again without that instruction.
