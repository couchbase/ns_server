# Prompt

The top-level files in this folder contain team-wide prompts for converting Angular 1 (ng1) and Angular 2 (ng2) code to React created by Pavel Blagodov:

- Angular 1
  - [[ng1.service.prompt]]
  - [[ng1.component.prompt]]
- Angular 2
  - [[ng2.component.prompt]]

> NOTE: You can differentiate between Angular 1 and Angular 2 components by their filenames. Angular 1 components have `_` (underscores) in their filenames, Angular 2 have `.` (dots).
